 * Filename:     listing2binsource.c
 *
 * Purpose:      This program assists in creating an executable
 *               binary from AGC programs like Luminary or Colossus.
 *               Unlike yaYUL (which processes the assembly language
 *               to product an executable) or oct2bin (which processes
 *               an octal listing to produce an executable),
 *               listing2binsource processes octal codes from the columns
 *               in an assembly listing (which are parallel to the
 *               assembly language). This is helpful for a listing
 *               like the Colossus237 assembly listing obtained
 *               from Fred Martin in which the octal-listing section
 *               is missing completely, and yet we still need an
 *               executable obtained separately from yaYUL in order
 *               to cross-check the data entry of the assembly language.

 * Mods:         2010-12-11 RSB    Began.
 *               2010-12-19 RSB    Added the synonyms :.& for
 *                                 the commands c, p, and a.
 *               2010-12-23 RSB    Now allow comments, prefixed
 *                                 with #.
 *               2010-12-25 RSB    Allow '+' in place of 'a' or
 *                                 '&', because Dragon
 *                                 NaturallySpeaking 11 no longer
 *                                 allows me to use '&' the way
 *                                 DNS 8 did.  Sigh ....
 *               2012-09-17 JL     Tidy up. Handle pages with just
 *                                 an address line. Handle lines
 *                                 with whitespace at the end.
 *                                 Fix handling of fixed-fixed 
 *                                 addresses. Take input and output
 *                                 filenames as arguments.
 *               2012-09-18 JL     Add bugger word generation. Add
 *                                 verbose option. Add debug prints.
 *
 * For listing2binsource.c, the octal codes are provided in an input file
 * created by moving through the assembly-language portion of the
 * assembly listing page by page and line by line.  The octal codes
 * are 5-digit octal numbers delimited either by commas or newlines
 * (whichever seems convenient at the time).  Interspersed with lines
 * containing octal codes are lines of one of the following forms:
 *
 * pN          (N being a 1-4 digit page number from the assembly listing)
 * aNNNN       (NNNN being a 4-digit octal number indicating the
 *             CPU location counter for the next section of octal codes)
 * aNN,NNNN    (Same, but with banked address NN,NNNN instead)
 * cNNNN       (The address of the preceding octal code)
 * cNN,NNNN    (Same, but with a banked address NN,NNNN instead)
 *
 * The following synonyms are also accepted:
 *   :    in place of     c
 *   .    in place of     p
 *   &    in place of     a
 *   +    in place of     a
 *
 * These synonyms can be remembered easily since "colon", "period"
 * (or "point"), or "and" or "add" (or "ampersand")  begin with the
 * same letter as the commands they're replacing.  The synonyms are
 * very convenient when dictating the octal listing using
 * Dragon NaturallySpeaking in "numbers" mode, since with these
 * synonyms (and the words "comma" and "newline") *all* of the
 * data-entry can be dictated without needing to use the keyboard
 * for anything other than corrections.
 *
 * The pN, cNNNN, and cNN,NNNN codes would not be necessary *if*
 * data entry is perfectly accurate, but are pragmatically necessary
 * for debugging data entry because they allow listing2binsource to
 * determine that the correct number of octal codes have been entered
 * for any given address range, and all warning messages to be printed
 * that localize such mismatches to the page.  It does not allow any
 * determination that the octal codes are *correct*, of course.
 * (Without an octal listing appearing in the assembly listing, the
 * memory-bank checksums are unknown.  They can be computed by
 * listing2binsource, but cannot be checked by listing2binsource.)  Thus,
 * while pN, cNNNN, and cNN,NNNN are optional, listing2binsource will
 * print warning messages wherever such a message would be useful
 * but is not found.  In particular:
 *
 *   - It is expected that pN lines appear in the order p1, p2, p3, ...
 *     pLAST throughout the input file, without any missing pages.  (If
 *     there are no octal codes on a page, its pN should appear anyway.)
 *
 *   - A cNNNN or cNN,NNNN should appear before every pN (except for
 *     the first page or if the preceding page contained no octal codes).
 *
 *   - A cNNNN or cNN,NNNN should appear before every aNNNN or aNN,NNNN
 *    (except those immediately preceded by a pN).
 *
 * Whitespace (including completely blank lines) is ignored by
 * listing2binsource, as are commas at the ends of lines.
 *
 * The input file is read on stdin, and a file capable of being used
 * as input to Oct2Bin is written on stdout.  printError and warning messages
 * are written to stderr.  The return value is zero on success, and
 * is non-zero if there were any warnings or errors.
