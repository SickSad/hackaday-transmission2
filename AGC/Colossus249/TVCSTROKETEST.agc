# NAME		STROKE TEST PACKAGE		(INCLUDING INITIALIZATION PACKAGE)
# ORIGINAL CODING BY OLSSON			LOG SECTION....STROKE TEST PACKAGE
# MOD BY ENGEL					DATE....21 MARCH, 1967
#
# FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION....
#	STROKE TEST PACKAGE GENERATES A WAVEFORM DESIGNED TO EXCITE BENDING
#	STRKTSTI (STROKE TEST INITIALIZATION) IS CALLED AS A JOB BY VB68.
#		IT INITIALIZES ALL ERASABLES REQD FOR A STROKE TEST, AND
#		THEN TESTS FOR AN 80MS DAP.  IF 80MS IT SETS STROKER = ESTROKER
#		FOR AN IMMEDIATE STROKE TEST, OTEHRWISE IT MERELY ENABLES
#		A STROKE TEST BY SETTING STROKER TO -0.  THE STROKE TEST
#		THEN AWAITS SWITCHOVER TO THE 80MS DAP WHEREUPON IT IS
#		ENABLED AFTER AN ADDITIONAL 4 SECOND DELAY TO AVOID
#		THE SWITCHOVER TRANSIENTS (SEE STRKCALL, STRKUP IN
#		TVCEXECUTIVE)
#	HACK (STROKE TEST) GENERATES THE WAVEFORM BY DUMPING PULSE BURSTS
#		OF PROPER SIGN AND IN PROPER SEQUENCE DIRECTLY INTO
#		TVCPITCH, WORKING IN CONJUNCITON WITH BOTH PITCH AND YAW
#		TVC DAPS, WITH INTERMEDIAT WAITLIST CALLS.  NOTE, HOWEVER
#		THAT THE STROKE TEST IS PERFORMED ONLY IN THE PITCH AXIS.
#		AN EXAMPLE WAVEFORM IS GIVEN BELOW, TO DEMONSTRATE STROKE-
#		TEST PARAMETER SELECTION.
#	RESTARTS CAUSE TEST TO BE TERMINATED.  ANOTHER V68 REQD IF TEST
#		IS TO BE RE-RUN.
#	PULSE BURST SIZE IS PAD-LOADED (ESTROKER) SO THAT AMPLITUDE OF
#		WAVEFORM CAN BE CHANGED.  THERE ARE TEN PULSE BURSTS IN
#		THE HALF-AMPLITUDE OF THE FIRST FREQUENCY SET IN THE
#		STANDARD WAVEFORM.  AMPLITUDE IS 10(ESTROKER)(1/42.15),
#		NOMINALLY 50/42.15 = 1.185 DEG
#
# CALLING SEQUENCE....
