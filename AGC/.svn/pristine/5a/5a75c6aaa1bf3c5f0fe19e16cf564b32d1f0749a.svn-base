  Filename:	SplitInterp.c
  Purpose:	This is a little utility that takes a 15-bit word from an
  		AGC binary executable and splits it apart to see what 
		interpretive codes it might have included.  I am using this
		solely for reverse engineering Block 1 interpretive language.
		(I must have done something similar for Block 2, but don't 
		know what it was.)
