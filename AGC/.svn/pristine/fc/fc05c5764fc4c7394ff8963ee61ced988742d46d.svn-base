The program "LM_Simulator" is an add-on to Ron Burkey's "yaAGC" (Apollo Guidance Computer Simulation /
http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/index.html).
It evolved from a simple BIT-Monitor to that what it is today, a Lunar Module System Simulator.
The program has been developed by using the interpreter programming language TCL/TK available on
nearly all LINUX distributions. To cover the Windows world a stand-alone application can be downloaded.
