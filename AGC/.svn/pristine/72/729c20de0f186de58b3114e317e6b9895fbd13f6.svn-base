# UPFLAG AND DOWNFLAG ARE ENTIRELY GENERAL FLAG SETTING AND CLEARING SUBROUTINES.  USING THEM, WHETHER OR
# NOT IN INTERRUPT, ONE MAY SET OR CLEAR ANY SINGLE, NAMED BIT IN ANY ERASABLE REGISTER, SUBJECT OF COURSE TO
# EBANK SETTING.  A "NAMED" BIT, AS THE WORD IS USED HERE, IS ANY BIT WITH A NAME FORMALLY ASSIGNED BY THE YUL
# ASSEMBLER.
#
# AT PRESENT THE ONLY NAMED BITS ARE THOSE IN THE FLAGWORDS.  ASSEMBLER CHANGES WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO
# NAME ANY BIT IN ERASABLE MEMORY.
#
# CALLING SEQUENCES ARE AS FOLLOWS --
#		TC	UPFLAG			TC	DOWNFLAG
#		ADRES	NAME OF FLAG		ADRES	NAME OF FLAG
#
# RETURN IS TO THE LOCATION FOLLOWING THE "ADRES" ABOUT .58 MS AFTER THE "TC".
# UPON RETURN A CONTAINS THE CURRENT FLAGWRD SETTING.
