This directory contains files of yaAGC debug-mode commands,
which can be loaded using the FROMFILE command in yaAGC.
The *.PAT files specifically are used to trap when a given
type of instruction executes.  Assuming there are no bugs,
I believe that each instruction-type has a proper script,
except for NOOP as executed in fixed memory.
