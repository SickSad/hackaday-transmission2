 *  Filename:	oct2bin.c
 *
 *  Purpose:	For the purpose of validating yaYUL, Luminary131, and
 *  		Colossus249 the binary from the Luminary131 and Colussus249
 *		source-code listings is checked against the yaYUL-produced
 *		binary produced from the source-code in those listings.
 *		This checking is most-easily done by the computer, which
 *		implies that the Luminary/Colossus source AND the
 *		Luminary/Colossus binary must separately be entered into
 *		the computer.  (Of course, once the binaries are entered
 *		they can also be used directly with yaAGC, whether or not
 *		yaYUL or the Luminary/Colossus sources are correct.)
 *		But entering binary data directly into the computer is not
 *		very convenient (particularly when it is originally listed
 *		in octal 15-bit format), so an intermediate ASCII format
 *		is used.  Then, a program (namely this one, oct2bin) is used
 *		to convert the intermediate file to binary.

 *  Mode:	08/24/03 RSB	Began.
 *  		08/31/03 RSB	Added some additional checks for the kind of
 *				garbage produced by OCR.
 *		09/07/03 RSB	Made error messages a little cleaner.
 *		08/12/04 RSB	Added NVER.
 *		04/30/05 RSB	Unused variable removed.
 *		05/14/05 RSB	Corrected website references
 *		01/02/06 RSB	Now allow commas to appear as delimiters.
 *				This is done because I find it convenient
 *				when entering data using Dragon
 *				NaturallySpeaking 8.
 *		05/20/09 RSB	Added the --invert command-line switch.
 *				With this switch, the program reverses the
 *				normal process, taking a binary file and
 *				turning it into a textual file.  Such a
 *				file is helpful in proofing when converting
 *				a set of page images to source-code files,
 *				since when you assemble the source-code files
 *				so-created the result usually won't be what
 *				it's supposed to, and at some point you have
 *				to compare the binary created by yaYUL against
 *				the binary in the page images.  Also added
 *				the --page switch.
 *		11/22/10 RSB    Added the CHECKWORDS=Count variable to
 *                              supplement the existing BANK=BankNumber
 *                              variable.  CHECKWORDS is the number of words
 *                              participating in the checksum, including the
 *                              bugger word.  It defaults to 02000, which is
 *                              the number of words in a bank.  This is
 *                              normally okay, since any unuused words
 *                              following the bugger word are zero.  But with
 *                              Solarium 055, some banks have data stored
 *                              *after* the bugger word, and shouldn't
 *                              participate in the checksum.  The CHECKWORDS
 *                              variable is used when necessary to compensate
 *                              for that funky fact.  It must *follow* the
 *                              BANK variable when it's used.  Also, I added the
 *                              NUMBANKS variable, which should precede any
 *                              bank and give the total number of banks.
 *                              Defaults to 044.  Both of the new variables
 *                              are in octal.
 *              2012-09-18 JL   Tidy up for Colossus237. Split common code
 *                              out to a separate utilities module.
 *
 *  The format of the file is simple.  Each line just consists of 8 fields,
 *  delimited by whitespace.  Each field consists of 5 octal digits.  Blank
 *  lines and lines beginning with ';' are ignored.
 *
 *  The checksum of any given bank is equal to the sum of all of the words
 *  in the bank, including the so-called "bugger" word, which follows all of the
 *  valid data.  The sum is supposed to be equal to the bank number.  Filler
 *  words of 0 should be added after the bugger word, so that the banks never
 *  end prematurely
 *
 *  Oct2Bin internally attempts to compute the checksum, thus providing an
 *  additional check on the data.  To account for this, the data for each bank
 *  should be preceded by a line that reads
 *  	BANK=BankNumber
 *
 *  The input is on stdin. Status messages are on stdout. The binary is written
 *  to a file called oct2bin.bin.
 *
 *  If the command-line switch --invert is used, then the input should be a binary
 *  file called oct2bin.bin, and the output will be a text file named oct2bin.binsource.
 *  When --invert is used, the switch --page=N can be used to select a starting page
 *  number for the binary listing, so as to create something that corresponds to the
 *  set of page images.
