AGC Signal Cross-reference Utility
----------------------------------
(Jim Lawton, 2009)

This is a utility to generate a signal cross-reference list from 
AGC schematics. 

Yawl is a Python program to process a signal list, derived (by hand) 
from the AGC Block II schematics and to produce several outputs.

The input file (default: agc_signals.txt) is generated by hand. The output 
files generated by Yawl are also stored here for reference:

  - A signal dictionary (example: agc_wirelist_dictionary.txt)
    This contains fields for "description" and "type" for each signal which 
    can be hand-annotated. Yawl will preserve hand-annotated fields when it
    regenerates the output files.

  - A signal cross-reference (example: agc_wirelist_xref.txt)
    This lists every signal, and for each signal shows the source and sink 
    schematic pages.

  - A signal page count (example: agc_wirelist_pagecount.txt)
    This lists every signal, and for each signal shows the pages it appears
    on and the number of occurrences on each page.

  - An error listing (example: agc_wirelist_errors.txt) 
    This lists signals with no sink or source, or singals with multiple sources.


Usage: Using the default signals file (agc_signals.txt), just do:
    # python ./yawl.py
