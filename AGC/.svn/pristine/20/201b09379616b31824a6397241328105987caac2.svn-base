# Filename:	Makefile
# Purpose:	Makefile for the AGS (AEA) simulation,
# Contact:	Ron Burkey <info@sandroid.org>
# Reference:	http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/yaAGS.html
# Mods:		2005-02-13 RSB	Adapted from yaAGC Makefile
#		2005-06-02 RSB	... continued.
#		2005-08-04 RSB	Added the CURSES variable.
#		2005-08-06 RSB	... removed it again, and added a path
#				where libcurses.a can be found on some systems.
#				(Sometimes it is in /usr/lib, sometimes in
#				/usr/lib/curses, maybe other places as well.
#		2009-03-06 RSB	Added the 'all-archs' target and adjusted
#				'clean' appropriately.
#		.......... OH	... something ...
#		2009-04-25 RSB	Fixed up the all-archs target.  Fixed up the
#				native-Mac build.
#		2009-05-03 RSB	Adjusted for SOLARIS.
#		2009-08-01 RSB	Added NormalizeSourceName.o.  Disabling
#				readline for Win32 because of Vista problems.
#				... Nope, doesn't work at all without readline
#				any longer.  Reenabled.  Adjusted to link
#				to libcurses, to try and use a newer version
#				of libreadline.
