  Filename:	WinAGC.c
  Purpose:	This is a process manager for Virtual AGC in Win32.
   		It allows an orderly shutdown of all Virtual AGC processes
		after you exit from any one process.  (In other words
		exiting yaDSKY can shutdown yaAGC as well, and vice versa.)
		I was able to accomplish this perfectly well in Linux just
		with shell scripts, but Win32 is so crippled that I had
		to write an exe file to do it.  (Windows XP Pro contains
		programs TASKLIST and TASKKILL that allow appropriate scripts
		to be written, but Windows XP Home, and probably every other
		earlier version of Windows does not.)
  Compiler:	GNU gcc.

  Mods:		07/12/05 RSB	Created.  Note:  Right now, there's a
  			        problem with this program in that if
				you run yaAGC under it, it essentially 
				uses up all available CPU time. (Whereas 
				if you run yaAGC from a command line 
				or a batch file, it takes an immeasurably 
				small amount of CPU time.)
  		03/08/09 RSB	Tried a workaround for the 100% CPU time
				mentioned above. Increased the max command-line
				length from 128 to 256.
		04/25/09 RSB	Allow the startup delay to be changed from
				the command line, and changed the default to
				0 (was hard-coded at 30 seconds)
		08/02/09 RSB	The arbitrary limit I placed on command-line
				length was too arbitrary, and is easily 
				exceeded when command-line debugging is performed.
				Increased it from 256 to 2048, which should be
				tremendous overkill.

  This program expects to receive a list of command-lines for processes,
  separated by \n and/or \r, on the standard input.  It ignores white lines
  and lines that begin with '#'.
  
  For example, if the file test.txt contained
    	yaAGC --core=Luminary131.bin --cfg=LM.ini
	start yaDSKY --cfg=LM.ini --test-downlink
  then 
  	WinAGC <test.txt
  would execute the two commands shown, as separate processes, closing them
  both down when either one of them terminated.
