# This just duplicates a few of the CM "Quick Start" steps from 
# http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/index.html.  I'm not certain 
# exactly what has to be done to put the AGC in a state in which
# it's receptive, but doing a V35E from the true DSKY seems to 
# do it.  However, if the AGC isn't in a receptive state, all of
# these commands will really be goofed up.

# What the following line would do is to open up an X-window and
# display a message.  (Of course, this wouldn't work in Microsoft
# Windows, so that's why it's commented out.  Uncomment it if you
# want to see it in action.) The same applies to the other lines 
# below beginning with "#!". (You have to keep the ! when you remove
# the #.)  A more typical thing to do here might be to play back an 
# audio clip, but I didn't want to take the liberty of doing that!  
# (Not to mention that I don't know what software is installed on 
# your computer anyway.
