# Filename:	Makefile
# Purpose:	Makefile for the jWiz program.
# Mods:		2009-04-08 RSB	Adapted from yaTelemetry makefile.
#		2009-04-14 RSB	Added some stuff for building in Mac OS X.
#		.......... OH	... something ...
#		2009-04-25 RSB	Undid some stylistic cleanups that broke the 
#				all-archs target.
#		2009-05-02 RSB	Added DEV_STATIC.

# For cross-platform building --- i.e., for building Win32 and Mac OS X versions
# of VirtualAGC on a Linux platform --- it is assumed that the IMCROSS
# environment (www.sandroid.org/imcross) is installed.  It is further supposed
# that the IMCROSS installation directory is ~/IMCROSS and that ~/IMCROSS/bin 
# is in the PATH.  The following variables just reflect the default setup for
# IMCROSS.

PREFIX_WIN=i386-mingw32
PREFIX_MAC=powerpc-apple-darwin9
BIN_WIN=${HOME}/IMCROSS/i386-mingw32/bin
BIN_MAC=${HOME}/IMCROSS/mac/bin
INC_MAC=${HOME}/IMCROSS/mac/include
SDK_MAC=${HOME}/IMCROSS/mac/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk

ifdef MACOSX
# For native building in Mac OS X.
MACFLAG=-DISMACOSX
endif

# This is just so that when I build it, I can insure that it will be statically or
# dynamically linked in the binary installers, according to my current whims.
# For anybody else, it will just accept whatever your wxWidgets default library is.

# Normally, the compiler can create a universal binary without having to
# do separate compilations for the different architectures and combining
# them afterward, the way I do below, but for some reason there are 
# separate C++ header files associated with iostreams for each architecture,
# and the compiler can't find them unless I specify the architecture-dependent
# directories in which they're located.  I am completely confused by the
