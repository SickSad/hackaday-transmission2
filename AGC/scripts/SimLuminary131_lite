# This shell script runs the LM elements of the Virtual AGC 
# emulation for software version 131 of Luminary.  This "lite" version
# uses the DSKY simulation of the LM_Simulator program rather than yaDSKY.

# What all the stuff with PIDS does is to record the process IDs of all the 
# programs we start.  We use this list to terminate all of them if any of 
# them terminates.

# Notice a lot of commented-out lines that say "xterm ...".  It's nicer in 
# a lot of ways to run these various apps inside of X-terminals, but opens
# up so incredibly many windows on the screen that I don't do it normally.
# Just remove the comment symbol from in front of any apps that you want in
# an xterm.  For example, if you want to run yaAGC with the --debug switch.
