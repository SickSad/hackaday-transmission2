# E/BKCALL	FOR DOING BANKCALLS FROM AND RETURNING TO ERASABLE.
#
# THIS ROUTINE IS CALLABLE FROM ERASABLE RO FIXED.  LIKE BANKCALL, HOWEVER, SWITCHING BETWEEN S3 AND S4
# IS NOT POSSIBLE.

# THE CALLING SEQUENCE IS

#	RETURN HERE FROM DISPLAY TERMINATE, BADD STALL OR TC Q.
#	RETURN HERE FROM DISPLAY PROCEED OR GOOD RETURN FROM STALL.
#	RETURN HERE FROM DISPLAY ENTER OR RECYCLE.
#
# THIS ROUTINE REQUIRES TWO ERASABLES (EBUF2, +1) IN UNSWITCHED WHICH ARE UNSHARED BY INTERRUPTS AND
# OTHER EMEMORY PROGRAMS.
#
# A + L ARE PRESERVED THROUGH BANKCALL AND E/BKCALL.
