  Filename:	nbfgets.c
  Purpose:	A portable (i.e., Linux AND Win32) non-blocking variant of fgets. 
  		Requires pthreads (on *nix) or "POSIX Threads for Win32"
		(http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32/).
  Compiler:	GNU gcc.
  Contact:	Ron Burkey <info@sandroid.org>
  Reference:	http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/index.html
  Mods:		08/09/04 RSB.	Began.
		02/27/05 RSB	Added the license exception, as required by
				the GPL, for linking to Orbiter SDK libraries.
		05/14/05 RSB	Corrected website references.
		07/13/05 RSB	Fixed the of using too much CPU time in Win32.
		07/30/05 JMS    Added use of GNU libreadline to read in the
		                debug command, and source file name completion.
		08/13/05 RSB	Added an initializer for nbfgetsCond, on the
				advice of "grosman".
		... undocumented changes apparently occurred here ...
		08/01/09 RSB	Changed incorrect usage of returned string 
				from readline(), which could be NULL.
                11/22/10 RSB    Eliminated a compiler warning I encountered
                                in Ubuntu 10.04.
