  Filename:	yaYUL.c
  Purpose:	This is an assembler for Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC)
  		assembly language.  It is called yaYUL because the original
		assembler was called YUL, and this "yet another YUL".
  Contact:	Ron Burkey <info@sandroid.org>
  Website:	www.ibiblio.org/apollo/index.html
  Mode:		04/11/03 RSB.	Began.
  		07/03/04 RSB.	Now writes the binary file, but does not
				yet compute the bugger words.  This is
				principally useful as a temporary measure
				to allow me to assemble Validation.s, 
				which doesn't use the bugger words.
		07/04/04 RSB	Now returns non-zero if there are fatal
				errors in assembly.
		07/07/04 RSB	Added the predefined symbol "$7".
		07/26/04 RSB	Added --force.
		07/30/04 RSB	Added terminating bugger words to banks.
		08/12/04 RSB	Added NVER.
		05/14/05 RSB	Corrected website reference.
		07/27/05 JMS	(04/30/05) Write symbol table to binary file 
				with --g flag.
		07/28/05 RSB	Made --g the default.  Still accepts the
				--g switch, but it doesn't do anything.
		07/28/05 JMS    Added support for writing SymbolLines_to to symbol
		                table file.
		03/17/09 RSB	Make sure there's no .bin file produced on error.
		06/06/09 RSB	Corrected the address offsets printed in the 
				bugger word table.  (Was printing addresses like
				33,1777 rather than 33,3777.)
		06/27/09 RSB	Added some stuff for HtmlOut.  Don't know yet if
				it will actually go anywhere, or if I'm just
				messing around.	
		07/25/09 RSB	Began adding the --block1 feature.  Since there's
				mostly source-level compatibility, the way 
				I'm *trying* to do this is to just basically
				do a normal assembly but to substitute different
				binary codes at the final step and to limit
				the memory size differently.  I'm sure I'll
				have to add additional tweaks as I go along.
		02/20/10 RSB	Added --unpound-page.
